## Project Overview  
This repository contains a responsive HTML page created by converting a Figma design into code. The implementation uses **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap** to ensure a pixel-perfect, fully responsive layout compatible across desktop and mobile devices.  

The design focuses on providing a seamless and visually appealing user interface, matching the provided Figma design specifications.

## Approach  
### Responsive Design:

- Organized the code for maintainability and readability.  

### CSS and Styling:  
- Implemented custom CSS to closely match the Figma design, including typography, colors, and spacing.
